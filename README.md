# Elixir 101

__Presented by Jeremy Swinarton @ Kinetic Cafe, May 19, 2016__

Elixir is a modern, Ruby-like language that compiles to Erlang bytecode and runs on the Erlang VM. Elixir implements Erlang's concurrency model, which uses functional programming and an actor-like model, to achieve highly scalable, distributed, fault-tolerant systems.

## Agenda

* What is concurrency?

  * How concurrency works: threads and locks

* Why should we care?

  * No more free lunch: the proliferation of multi-core systems

* History of Erlang and Elixir

* How Elixir works

  * Processes (the "actor-like" model)

  * Message passing

  * Functional programming

  * Pattern matching
